#                                           **Data Structure Using Java**â˜•

### Welcome to my data structures repo!ðŸŒ 
*This repo contains the implementations in **Java** for basic data structures.*
Feel free to fork this repo or use it for your projects or for studies! :)
If there are any issues, raise an issue and I'll look into it as soo as I can.




## Contents
### Data Structures implemented:
1. Singly Linked List 
2. Circularly Linked List


### Packages and classes:
  

| Packages   | Classes          |
| -------- | -------------- |
| SinglyLinkedList | main(), LinkedList1(), Node()|
| CircularlyLinkedList |  main(), CircularLinkedList(), Node() |

---

### 1. Linked list:
Linked list is a data structure that is used to store data of anytype in special **_nodes_**. These nodes contain 2 attributes/feilds:
1. Data (The value we want to store)
2. Next (the address of the next node)

(note- You can use any name for the attributes while implimenting this data structure.)

## -- Please note  -- 
The repo may keep changing and updating based on the requirements. I will be adding new implementations.
